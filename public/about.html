<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Name: Ken, known as "Smoke" to my NG Family, born on August 9th, making me 29 years young. Blue is the color that brings joy to my heart, and Persona 5 is one of my favorite games of all time. I find pure bliss in the combination of delicious food especially Japanese Curry, soulful music, and learning  to code.</p>

<p>In terms of my bio, I believe in the power of love and respect, and I strive to reciprocate these values. If there's anything I can do to assist you, please don't hesitate to ask. I am a simple individual with a desire to make a meaningful impact on this world before my time here is over, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
